# sudoku
Back in 2013 before I started college, I challenged myself to try and make a sudoku solver on a flight from Chicago to the Bay area (Getting ready to go to school!)
Some of the interface stuff was done afterward.
Doesn't fare very well with difficult puzzles, but it can quickly solve medium difficulty puzzles.
At the moment there I don't have a better way to input starting board than putting in a long string of digits.
